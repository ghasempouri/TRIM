# TRIM
Trust and Reputation Interaction Model Framework (TRIM)
TRIM is a comprehensive and expressive model of an interacting agent environment with malicious agents along with an underlying Trust and Reputation system (TRS). To evaluate a TRS which is modeled through TRIM we present the TRIM-Checker tool. The tool has different functions which enable us to define system configuration, TRS configuration, and actions set as well as robustness measures. Working with these functions is not easy for the modelers, so we provided a Windows application for their convenience. This application has different tools to input components of TRIM framework. For example, to enter actions set and system configuration, a tabular tool is provided.
